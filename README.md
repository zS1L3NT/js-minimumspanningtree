Used to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted circuit.<br>
By Zechariah, C21B02

## Motivation

I used to take a subject called Logic and Mathematics, where I learnt about things like Graphs and Trees. We were taught ho to find a minimum spanning tree in the subject, but we did it ourselves and I wanted a way for a computer to do it for me. This lead me to write this script so I can find the minimum spanning tree with a visual representation of the tree.

## Usage

Go to [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/scratch-paper/new)<br>
Copy and paste the code in **main.js** into the right side of the screen where the code is<br>
Press **Build** then press **Play** to start the calculation of the minimum spanning tree.<br>

### Change Vertices and Edges

The variable named **vertices** is just the list of vertices that are on the graph.<br>
The variable named **edges** contains 3 things: Edge 1, Edge 2 and the Weight of the edge<br>
